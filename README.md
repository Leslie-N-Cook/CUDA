Part 1 - INFORMATION
You have access to two arrays. Array A, and Array B.
Both Arrays have the same length of (N=10240) integer locations.
Array A is initialized by an even sequence (2n) where n ranges from 0 to N-1. 
Array B is initialized by an odd sequence (2n+1) where n ranges from 0 to N-1.
GPU Cuda program that will compute array C which is the product between array A and B.
Uses only 10 block, with its maximum # of threads
